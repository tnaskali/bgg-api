    <description>1983: It all started in a small garage in the heart of Munich: Bernd Brunnhofer and Karl-Heinz Schmiel want to develop great board games!
      What started in the garage became one of the most successful German game publishers; Moritz Brunnhofer has since taken over the management. Two visionaries became 12 team members and over 40 years of company history.
